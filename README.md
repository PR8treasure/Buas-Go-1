# Buas-Go-1
The repository for the buas go app 
Hi members of my PR8 team.
To dowload the app u only have to dowload the WWW file.
The WWW file contains all code.
U can dowload the files using the Clone or Dowload button in the right corner. 
U can also view and edit the code without dowloading right here in Github. 
Be aware of the diffrent css files as a change will not always influence all pages.



Cheers

Freek
