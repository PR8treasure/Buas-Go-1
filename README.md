# Buas-Go-1
The repository for the buas go app 
Hi members of my PR8 team.
To dowload the app u only have to dowload the WWW file.
The WWW file contains all code.
U can dowload the files using the Clone or Dowload button in the right corner. 
U can also view and edit the code without dowloading right here in Github. 
Be aware of the diffrent css files as a change will not always influence all pages.


For the app to work well please adjust your screen to mobile size or open this on your mobile browser. 
The Quiz does not work in APK form because of some IFRAME problem that only works in a browser. 


Cheers

Freek
